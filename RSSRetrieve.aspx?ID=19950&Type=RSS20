    &lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;Yonward is thrilled to be working with the Cambridge Arts Council on Open Studios 2016!&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cambridge Arts Open Studios takes place Saturday, May 14 &amp;amp; Sunday, May 15, 2016 from 12-6 pm, and features the work of over 100 visual and performing
        artists. The Cambridge Arts team made a beautiful Yonward guide to help art explorers discover and find the 83 locations across the City that are
        participating. &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The guide can be found in the Yonward App - just look under Featured or Nearby (for those in Cambridge). &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To learn more, please see http://www.cambridgeartscouncil.org/openstudios&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's great to see Yonward put to use for this great event - we're looking forward to a fun weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;Designed in 1892 by the great American architect Henry Hobson Richardson for Mrs. Mary Fisk Stoughton, this house is considered the finest example
        of the Shingle Style in America. &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;The use of shingles instead of clapboards allowed for rounded features and continuous, non-rectangular forms as can be seen in the central stair bay
        to the left of the entrance.&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://americanrepertorytheater.org/oberon"&gt;OBERON&lt;/a&gt; is the A.R.T.’s second stage, a destination for theater and nightlife on the fringe
        of Harvard Square.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;In addition to offering work from the A.R.T’s main season, OBERON is also a thriving incubator for emerging artists to imagine new projects that could
        only exist in this exciting club theater environment. Hundreds of artists and performance groups brought work to the space each year. OBERON regularly
        features local performers including aerialists, beat poets, food artists, tap dancers, gender-bending sketch troupes, comedians, hula-hooping burlesquers,
        and pop-and-lock human statues to name but a few.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Rooted in the mission of OBERON, A.R.T. has launched a multi-year program of work and mentorship with three local performance groups: Boston Circus
        Guild, Liars &amp;amp; Believers, and Touch Performance Art. &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;The Sports Museum is a 501(c)(3) non-profit educational institution housed in the TD Garden that has served Boston and New England for more than 35
        years.&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;The Sports Museum celebrates the character of Boston sports -- the unique brand of teamwork, determination, responsibility, courage, fairness, and
        other qualities of character possessed by our teams and athletes that make Boston "The Greatest Sports City in America." Equally important, they
        use this distinctly rich heritage to help build character in kids so that they can stand strong in the face of drugs, violence, and other dangers.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The Ether Dome was Mass General's surgical amphitheater between 1821 and 1867. Dr. William T.G. Morton, a Boston dentist, made medical history here in
    Oct. 16, 1846, when he administered ether anesthetic to patient Gilbert Abbott just before Dr. John Collins Warren removed a tumor from his neck. Abbott
    slept comfortably during the operation and upon awakening announced that he had felt no pain. News of this first public demonstration of surgical anesthesia
    spread rapidly, transforming medical practice throughout the world.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sculpture commemorates Mary Dyer, who sacrificed her life for the right to religious freedom. Like her friend Anne Hutchinson, who is also commemorated
    with a sculpture on this Art Walk, Dyer challenged traditional Puritanism with her progressive beliefs. Governor John Winthrop repeatedly exiled Dyer
    from Massachusetts, but she returned to the colony nevertheless to visit imprisoned friends and protest her sentence. In 1660, she was hanged on the
    Boston Common for refusing to repent her supposedly heretical views.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sculptor Sylvia Shaw Judson - the author of The Quiet Eye: A Way of Looking at Pictures and herself a Quaker - has depicted Dyer in a reserved pose
    with no adornment. These qualities echo the value Quakers place on simplicity in speech, dress, and other aspects of everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Only 10.4 feet at it’s widest, the skinny house in Boston’s North end was, according to local lore, built entirely as a spite house. There are two
        stories of the house, the first being a vague account of an unarmed builder who acquired the lot and built the house to cut off air and light to
        a neighbor with whom he has a dispute. The second story is of two brothers who inherited the lot from their father. While one brother was away
        fighting in the civil war, the other brother built a large house on the property, leaving only a shred for his brother. To spite his brother, the
        returning soldier built a very tall and very thin house on the left over land that blocked his brother’s sunlight and ruined his view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harriet Jacobs was born into slavery in 1813. After being sexually harassed by her owner, Jacobs escaped in 1835. She hid in her grandmother's crawl space
    for seven years before traveling by boat to Philadelphia. Encouraged by abolitionist Amy Post, Jacobs began writing her life story in the evenings
    after work. "Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl" was published in 1861 under the pseudonym Linda Brent. Harriet Jacobs died on March 7th, 1897.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we’ve got some exciting numbers! Since we offered the very first version of Yonward in the App Store in July, the Yonward community has developed
    over 200 guides containing over 3,000 beacons, mostly around Cambridge and Boston, containing nearly 10,000 images and hundreds of audio recordings.
    Users are looking at the app over multiple days and weeks (which means they’re keeping it on their phone), and engaging in long, involved sessions
    (which means they’re finding the content interesting and useful). All good signs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several Cambridge and Mount Auburn Cemetery guides are our most popular so far, and Yonward guides to events such as Fluff Fest and HUBweek delivered a
    mobile solution where none existed before. We’re starting to see some nice guides popping up elsewhere – New York City, Hartford, San Francisco, Ohio,
    Mt. Rushmore – and even internationally. A number of these came from users who first found Yonward on a trip to the Boston area – this is exactly what
    we’re hoping for!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks as always to everyone Yonward community for all your support – never hesitate to let us know what we can be doing better!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://www.yonward.com/RSSRetrieve.aspx?ID=19950&amp;A=Link&amp;ObjectID=763852&amp;ObjectType=56&amp;O=http%253a%252f%252fwww.yonward.com%252fblog%252fa-quick-update</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.yonward.com/blog/a-quick-update</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Nov 2015 18:13:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Head of the Charles Regatta</title><description>&lt;p&gt;We're excited to announce the availability of native mobile guides to this weekend’s Head of the Charles rowing regatta, the largest and most prestigious
    race on the fall rowing calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Developed by regatta veterans and locals, the “Unofficial Guide to the Head of the Charles” covers all of the key venues at the regatta, and the “Transportation
        and Parking” guide offers helpful information for getting around. “A Rower’s Guide to the Charles” offers a broader view of the rowing scene in
        Boston. Photographs from row2k and Sculling Fool are featured by permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/P1010357s.jpg" style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; width: 980px;"&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yonward guides provide a mobile supplement to the paper programs and web-based tools provided by the Regatta for iPhone users who prefer all of the
    functionality and convenience of fully mobile maps and guides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yonward has come on the scene quickly over the past several months, and we have been thrilled to be mobile guide platform of choice for major events around
    Boston this fall including HUBweek, the HONK! Festival, and Oktoberfest,” said Tom Pounds, co-founder. “We look forward to being the Official mobile
    guide for the Head of the Charles and many other institutions and events in the future, and are happy to provide this unofficial version for interested
    users today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users can download Yonward in the App Store. In addition to the Regatta guides, you'll will find over 100 guides to a wide range of neighborhoods, institutions,
    and special interest areas, mostly around Cambridge and Boston. And best of all, the app and all the guides are free!&lt;/p&gt;
