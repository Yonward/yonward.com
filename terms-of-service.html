In appropriate circumstances, Yonward will also terminate a user’s account if the user is determined to be a repeat infringer.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>DMCA Take-Down Notices. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly provided to us. If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof and believe, in good faith, that your content has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide us with the following information in writing to Yonward designated copyright agent at Yonward, Inc., One Broadway, Cambridge, MA 02142: (i) the date of your notification; (ii) a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf; (iii) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site; (iv) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; (v) your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address; (vi) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vii) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
