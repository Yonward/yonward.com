    <p id="u4997-2">Yonward, Inc.</p>
    <p id="u4997-4">Privacy Policy</p>
    <p id="u4997-6">June 15, 2015</p>
    <p id="u4997-7">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Yonward, Inc. Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to provide a clear understanding of how we collect, store and use information to provide users with a better experience. For purposes of this Agreement, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” and Yonward refer to Yonward, Inc. “You” or “user” refers to you, as a user of the Yonward website, www.Yonward.com, and all subdomains thereof (the “Site”), the Yonward mobile software application (the “App”), related application programming interfaces, and notifications (the “Services”) and any information, text, graphics, photos, videos, or other materials uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the Services (collectively referred to as “Content”). Yonward is committed to maintaining privacy protections for its users. By using the Services, you expressly accept our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service and you consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information and other information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Yonward Privacy Policy is organized as follows:</p>
    <p>I Information we collect</p>
    <p>II How we use and share information</p>
    <p>III How we protect information</p>
    <p>IV Your rights regarding the use of your personal information</p>
    <p>V Links to other websites</p>
    <p>VI Changes to our privacy policy</p>
    <p>VII How to contact us</p>
    <p>VIII International Users</p>
    <p>IX California Privacy Rights.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u4997-33">I. Information We Collect</p>
    <p id="u4997-34">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We collect both “Personal Information” and “Non-Personal Information.” Personal Information is information that you submit to us either through the Site or the App or by registering for Yonward through another social networking site (such as Facebook), and that is personally identifiable (i.e. can be linked to a specific individual) such as your name, email address and telephone number. “Non-Personal Information” includes information that cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage data, general demographic information, geo-location data, platform types, number of clicks.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We collect various types of this information, including the following:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u4997-42">1. INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE US BY REGISTERING FOR A YONWARD ACCOUNT OR DOWNLOADING THE APP</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Visitors may access and use the Service without disclosing most Personal Information. In addition, we allow users to create their own profile through the App or the Site to provide users with a better and more customized experience; when a user creates a profile, we collect Personal Information that users voluntarily provide through the registration process.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Users can create a profile in two ways. First, users can register directly through the Site or on the App. When registering in this way, we collect a user’s name and email address, and offer the user the option of additionally providing their mailing address and gender. Second, users can register to create a Yonward profile by connecting through a third party social networking site (“SNS”) that already contains the user’s personal information, such as Facebook. The information you allow Yonward to access varies by SNS platform, and is affected by the privacy settings you establish at the respective SNS. For example, Yonward may access and store some or all of the following information, as allowed by you, the SNS, and your preferences:</p>
    <p>• Your first and last name</p>
    <p>• Your profile picture or its URL</p>
    <p>• The login email you provided to that SNS when you registered</p>
    <p>• The content you posted to that SNS, such as likes and comments, and other information.</p>
    <p>• Profile information such as your hometown, gender, interests and activities, and other information.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>By registering a Yonward profile through an SNS, you authorize Yonward to collect, store, and use any and all information you allow the SNS to provide to Yonward through that SNS’s application programming interface (which is the program that allows an SNS and Yonward to share information). Your agreement with Yonward and your acceptance of this Privacy Policy occurs when you accept or allow an SNS to register you for a Yonward account.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You have the option to use Yonward’ “Find friends” feature to locate other people with Yonward accounts either through (i) your contacts list, or (ii) third-party social networking sites. If you choose to find friends through your device’s contacts list, then Yonward will access your contacts list and determine whether or not your contacts are using Yonward. If you choose to find friends through a third-party social media site, then you will be prompted to set up a link to the third-party service and you understand that any information that such service may provide to Yonward will be governed by this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you invite someone to the Yonward service through the “Invite Friends” feature, you can select a person directly from your contacts list and send a text or email from your personal account. In doing so, you understand and agree that you are responsible for any charges that apply to communications sent from you device, and because this invitation is coming directly from your personal account, Yonward does not have access to or control this communication.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u4997-70">2. INFORMATION COLLECTED VIA TECHNOLOGY</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In addition to the personal information you voluntarily provide when you register for the Site or download the App, in an effort to improve the quality of Yonward’s service, we track information provided to us when you use the App or view the Site, such as the website you came from (known as the “referring URL”), the type of browser you use, the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify you. We do so by sending one or more cookies or similar persistent identifiers (such as universally unique identifiers) to your computer or mobile device that uniquely identifies your browser or device. A cookie is a small text file composed of alphanumeric letters, which includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to a user’s browser from our servers and is stored on the user’s computer hard drive. Doing so allows us to collect Non-Personal Information about our users and keep a record of user preferences when utilizing the Services, both on an individual basis and in the aggregate.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For example, Yonward may compile the the number of times a user:</p>
    <p>• Views their profile</p>
    <p>• Clicks on the map or views a beacon</p>
    <p>• Views a guide or beacon</p>
    <p>• Clicks through to other sites linked to Yonward</p>
    <p>• Views each guide or beacon</p>
    <p>• Shares a guide or beacon through a social network.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Yonward may use both persistent and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your session and until you delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser. For example, we store a persistent cookie to track your last known location on the Site or App map. This way, when you return to the map, the map can refresh at exactly the same place as it was when you left.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u4997-94">3. GEOLOCATION DATA COLLECTED</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you use the Services through the App, we will collect your geo-location information in order to provide a better Yonward experience that incorporates information about your location and surroundings. We will not share this information with third parties and will only use this information for the sole purpose of customizing your Yonward experience. You may at any time disable the collection of Services to track your location by turning this off at the device level.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u4997-100">II. How We Use and Share Information</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u4997-103">1. PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share for marketing purposes the Personal Information that we collect with third parties without your consent. We may share Personal Information with vendors who are performing services for Yonward on behalf of Yonward, such as the servers for our email communications who are provided access to your email address for purposes of sending you emails from us. Those vendors only use your Personal Information at our direction and in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>The Personal Information you provide to us is used to enhance your experience with Yonward and to help us communicate with you. For example, our use of Personal Information may include, but is not limited to, responding to users’ questions, soliciting feedback and input form users, providing technical support, and informing members about product or promotional offers. We may also use it to serve customized advertising.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u4997-111">2. NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>
    <p id="u4997-112">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We use Non-Personal Information to help us improve Yonward products and services and customize the user experience. We also aggregate Non-Personal Information to use in statistical analyses to help us track trends and analyze patterns in the use of Yonward. This Privacy Policy does not limit our use or disclosure of any Non-Personal Information in any way, and we reserve the right to use and disclose such Non-Personal Information to our partners, advertisers, and other third parties at our discretion.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u4997-117">3. MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS AND SIMILAR BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS</p>
    <p id="u4997-118">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge and consent that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of ours or that acquirer’s assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u4997-123">4. SHARING INFORMATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT OR AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY LAW</p>
    <p id="u4997-124">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We may use or disclose information collected on the Site or the App to resolve disputes or investigate problems. We may disclose or access such information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or if we consider it necessary to maintain the Services and improve our products and services.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u4997-129">5. CHANGES</p>
    <p id="u4997-130">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will provide notice through the App and/or post the policy changes to our Site or the App to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check the Site periodically.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u4997-135">III. How We Protect Information</p>
    <p id="u4997-136">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>While there is no practical way to absolutely assure the security of information you supply us, we implement strong security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. Your user accounts are protected by the password you use to access your online account with Yonward, and we urge you to take steps to keep your personal information (including your password) safe, and to log out of your account after use.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Once we have received your information, we also take precautions against possible security breaches of the Services and customer databases by putting in place technological security measures, including [encryption, firewalls, and secure socket layer technology]. However, this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software. By visiting the Site or using the Services or the App, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u4997-144">IV. Your Rights Regarding the Use of Your Personal Information</p>
    <p id="u4997-145">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You have a right at any time to stop us from contacting you for marketing purposes. If you receive promotional communications from us, you will be able to indicate a preference to stop receiving further promotional communications from us and will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the promotional e-mail.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Please note that despite any indicated email marketing preferences, we may send you administrative emails regarding Yonward, including, for example, notices of updates to our Privacy Policy if we choose to provide such notices to you in this manner.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u4997-153">V. Links to Other Websites</p>
    <p id="u4997-154">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As part of the Services, Yonward may provide links to other websites or applications that we believe may be of interest to our users. We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by those websites, nor are we responsible for the information or content they contain. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us through Yonward; when you use a link to go from our website to another third party website, this Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. The privacy policy of that other website or application will apply to your access or use of that site or application. We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of these other websites or applications before proceeding to use them.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u4997-159">VI. Changes to Our Privacy Policy</p>
    <p id="u4997-160">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Yonward reserves the right to change this Policy and our Terms of Service at any time. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat Personal Information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your account, or by placing a prominent notice on the App or our Site, so that you can choose whether to continue using the Service. Significant changes will go into effect 30 days after we notify you. Non-material changes or clarifications will take effect immediately. You should periodically check the Site for updates.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u4997-165">VII. How to Contact Us</p>
    <p id="u4997-166">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy or the practices of the Services, the Site or the App please contact us by sending an email to info@Yonward.com.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p id="u4997-171">VIII. International Users</p>
    <p id="u4997-172">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Services, the Site and the App are hosted and operated in the United States of America. Those who access or use the Services, the Site or the App from other jurisdictions do so at their own choice and risk and are solely responsible for compliance with local law.

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you are not a resident of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect and use your personal information outside your home jurisdiction, and that we may store your personal information in the United States.
